# Sperm Racer: Technical Plan

## Architecture Overview

The game will be built using a component-based architecture with the following structure:

```

├── page.tsx                  # Main entry point
├── layout.tsx                # Root layout
├── components/
│   ├── game/
│   │   ├── Game.tsx          # Main game component (client component)
│   │   ├── Canvas.tsx        # Game canvas renderer
│   │   ├── Player.tsx        # Player entity
│   │   ├── AIOpponent.tsx    # AI opponent entity
│   │   ├── Track.tsx         # Race track
│   │   ├── Joystick.tsx      # Virtual joystick component
│   │   ├── Timer.tsx         # Race timer
│   │   └── GameOver.tsx      # Game over screen
│   ├── ui/
│   │   ├── Button.tsx        # Reusable button

```

## Game Engine Design

### Canvas Rendering
- Use HTML5 Canvas for rendering the game
- Implement a game loop with requestAnimationFrame
- Scale canvas for different screen sizes

### Physics System
- Implement simple velocity and acceleration
- Add friction and collision response
- Handle boundary collisions

### Entity System
- Base Entity class/interface for all game objects
- Specialized entities (Player, AIOpponent)
- Collision groups for different entity types

## Game Mechanics

### Player Controls
- Virtual joystick for mobile (using NippleJS)
- Keyboard controls (WASD/Arrow keys) for desktop
- Handle multi-touch for mobile devices

### AI Behavior
- Pathfinding along predefined waypoints
- Variable speed and "personality" for different opponents
- Collision avoidance between AI racers

### Track Design
- Single track with checkpoints
- Start/finish line
- Track boundaries and collision

### Game States
1. Title Screen - Game introduction
2. Ready - Countdown before race starts
3. Racing - Main gameplay
4. Finished - Display race results
5. Game Over - Option to restart

## Performance Considerations

### Mobile Optimization
- Asset preloading and compression
- Throttle physics calculations on lower-end devices
- Optimize canvas rendering

### Memory Management
- Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Garbage collection minimization
- Asset unloading when not needed

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework (Week 1)
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
- Create basic canvas renderer
- Implement simple entity system
- Add player movement with keyboard controls

### Phase 2: Game Mechanics (Week 2)
- Implement track design
- Add collision detection
- Create virtual joystick for mobile
- Implement race timing

### Phase 3: AI and Gameplay (Week 3)
- Add AI opponents
- Implement game states
- Add race countdown and finish
- Create score system

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (Week 4)
- Add visual effects and feedback
- Optimize for mobile performance
- Add sound effects
- Cross-browser testing

## Dependencies

- **Next.js**: Framework for the web application
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Shadcn UI**: UI components
- **NippleJS**: Virtual joystick implementation
- **Canvas API**: Game rendering

## Testing Strategy
- Performance testing on various mobile devices
